# How To Guide: Cutting X Rack to length

**Problem: Y Stalling/ Skipping**

In the factory we cut the ends of the X Rack, which is the **toothed rod** the print head moves on. You may be experiencing Y Stalling/ Skipping if the ends of your X Rack are not cut. Here are some simple steps to fix the problem:

1. One side of the X Rods will be glued to the sliders, one side will not.   
   **Hold** the slider in one hand, and the X Rack in the other.

2. While holding the slider and X Rack, _gently_ **pull** apart from each other.   
   _Please **be careful** as to not bend the Z Rods, only a **small gap** is needed_.

3.  **Rotate** the slider so the pegs point upwards. The X Axis is now free from the sliders.

4. **Trim** piece of plastic sticking out from X Rack.   
   _Use **wire cutters** or **diagonal cutters** for a clean cut._
