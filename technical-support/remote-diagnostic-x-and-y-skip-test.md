# Remote Diagnostic: X and Y Skip Test

The purpose of this test is to **diagnose your printer's X-axis and Y-axis movement.** This test will run the gantry system along the x-axis or y-axis to ensure it moves from end to end without skipping. 

Please upgrade to the latest software package, to run the following X and Y Skip diagnostic tests. Software Version 2015-03-24-9.4 is used as an example in this article.

1. Please **go to Expert mode** on the Advanced page in the Settings menu.

3. After selecting the Diagnostics tab, you have the option to perform a number of tests to diagnose X-axis and Y-axis movements.
   1. The Skip tests will step every 1 second along the X or Y axis, depending on which button you click.
   2. The Speed tests will quickly move the print head along the X or Y axis.
   3. During the skip tests, please watch and listen closely to see if the printer skips. You will see and possibly hear a slight stall/skip while the print head travels during the test.
   4. If you determine the printer skips in one or both directions, use the [X-Axis Services](https://printm3d.com/solutions/article.php?id=39) and [Y-Axis Services](https://printm3d.com/solutions/article.php?id=38) support pages to find a solution. Also, you can report your findings to our tech support team. ![](https://printm3d.com/solutions/assets/img_557f039298304.png)
