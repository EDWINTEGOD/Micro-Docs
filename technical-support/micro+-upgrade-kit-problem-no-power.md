# Micro+ Upgrade Kit Problem \(No Power\)

If your Micro is not powering up after installing the Micro+ upgrade, check the two main plugs on the new cable assembly and make sure that they are plugged into the correct connectors on the PCB. When looking at the printer from the front, the cable marked "A" should be in the connector that is furthest to the right.

If the cable assembly was plugged into the wrong connectors initially and the printer will not power up after switching the connectors to their correct positions it is usually an indication that the Micro Motion Chip in the extruder is now bad and needs to be replaced. A replacement MMC can be ordered directly from our parts website \(https://store.printm3d.com/collections/parts\).
