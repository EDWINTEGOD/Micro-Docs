If your print head crashes into the print bed during calibration, it is possibly due to the nozzle not being lower than the fan. Below are images depicting this.

| **Correct Nozzle Height** | **Nozzle height too low** |

* If the nozzle height is too low, it could be the fan is falling out of its position. Simply push it back up and apply a small amount of super glue.
* Or you can unscrew the nozzle a little bit in order to get the nozzle tip to the correct position
