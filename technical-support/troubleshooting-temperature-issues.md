As you can see in the photo above hot prints turn out stringy. You will want to lower temperatures to correct this.

\*When adjusting temperatures we recommend starting with a 10 degree jump and then working in increments of 5 if needed\*

**COLD**

Cold prints do not bond well and will lift off the print bed. They are also quite brittle. You will want to increase temperatures to correct this.
