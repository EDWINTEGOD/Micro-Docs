4. Now change the value to 100 and click the up arrow. This will retract the filament and you will gently pull on the filament until it is free from the print head.
5. If it doesn't come free, try clicking the up arrow one more time.
6. If it comes free, click the heater off button and you can close the Spooler window and operate your printer like normal.
