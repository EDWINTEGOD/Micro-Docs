# X-Axis Services



**Description of Problem**

The X Housing is how the extruder moves along the X axis \(or left to right\). There is a Rack and Rack Gear system that enables this movement. The Rack Gear is located inside the Extruder, and is part of the Housing X System. The Rack and X Carbon Rod slide into the Housing X System in the Extruder. They are supported on either side by the Sliders.

**Causes** + _Solutions_

* **Back X-rod is slightly oblong** 
  * _Solution:_ Take the back X carbon rod and spin it until the least amount of friction is felt. You should feel the rod tighten in certain spots when rotating and loosen in other spots. You want to leave the rod in the position that is loosest.  ![](https://printm3d.com/solutions/assets/img_5571e239900d9.png)  
* **Inconsistent glue thickness along the rack** - We apologize if the rack was not properly assembled for you.
  * _Solution:_ Apply ****a small amount of loctite super glue to the flat back of the rack. _Firmly_ press the rack against the carbon rod and allow the glue to settle. You could use a clamp to ensure the glue forms a solid bond between the rack and carbon rod. _Warning: if you use too much glue, the excess will splurge up towards the extruder head and potentially cause it to skip on the x-axis during print jobs._  
* **Print head does not move left to right at all** - If the X-skip test is performed and the print head has not moved left or right, this means the x-axis gear slid off of the x-axis motor shaft. \(As shown in image below\)
  * _Solution:_ Itâ€™s very simple to push this back on, but you will need to push it up the motor shaft like the 2nd picture.  **Orient** the gear properly so it slides up the flattened shaft a little bit. &gt; **Get** a flat head screwdriver. &gt; **Place** the flat head screwdriver between the carbon rods and gear. &gt; **Use**the flat head to push the gear up all the way up on the shaft. &gt; _The black gear should be flush with the black plastic housing for the x-axis motor. &gt;_ **Run** the X Skip test to confirm the printer no longer has skipping issues as it moves along the X-axis.

* **Replace X-rod and Rack** - Please view the [How To Guide: X-Rod and Rack Replacement](https://printm3d.com/solutions/article.php?id=74) article for more information.
