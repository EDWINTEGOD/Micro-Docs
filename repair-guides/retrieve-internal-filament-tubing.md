3. With a small prying tool, slowly work around the internal circle to lift up the piece the screws were holding down  
   NOTE: When attempting to fully pull up the piece held down by screws, please hold down the top portion of the printer so it does not get pulled up by the lower piece.

4. Once it's loose it can be lifted up along the threaded rods  
   Note: Continue to be careful that the top portion of the lid does not slide up

5. Locate the internal filament tubing and place it back into position. To prevent the internal tube from slipping back under the fluff again, add about 3-4 turns of black vinyl tape around the internal port tube, just behind the visible portion of the fluff.

7. Replace the four screws and tighten
8. Internal filament tubing is now ready to be used again
