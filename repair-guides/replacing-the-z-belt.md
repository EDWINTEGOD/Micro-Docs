# Replacing the z-belt



If your Z-belt is broken or needs replacing, here is a guide on how to swap out the belt.

1. One side of the x-rods will be glued to the sliders, one side will not.  **Hold** the slider in one hand, and the x-rack in the other.  ![](http://m3dhelp.com/support/assets/img_5570cbdf1efdc.png)
2. While holding the slider and X Rack, _gently_ **pull** apart from each other.  _Please **be careful** as to not bend the Z Rods, only a **small gap** is needed._  ![](https://printm3d.com/solutions/assets/img_5571bd22c1969.png)
3.  **Rotate** the slider so the pegs point upwards. The X Axis is now free from the sliders.  ![](https://printm3d.com/solutions/assets/img_5571bd3f5d6a0.png)  
4. **Take** the print head and begin to **slide** it off the x-rack towards the end that is free to remove from rack.  _Set print head aside_.  ![](https://printm3d.com/solutions/assets/img_557073139a9ee.png)     ![](https://printm3d.com/solutions/assets/img_5570734bba82f.png)  
5. Next, push down on a corner of the base and pull up on the same corner of the lid to remove the lid \(see picture below for technique\) ![](https://printm3d.com/solutions/assets/img_559410a528097.png)  
6. With the lid removed, you will see the z-belt running around the four pulleys on each threaded rod in the corners. Take a hook tool to grab the belt and slip it up and over the plastic base of the printer.
